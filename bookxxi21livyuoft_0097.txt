(2) It is analogous to the idiom of such a sentence as recitavislitteras,
quas me sibi misisse diceret, which is a confusion between (a) recitavit
litteras quas . . . dicebat, and (b) recitavit litteras quas sibi misissem,
where the subjunctive misissem is that of reported or alleged descrip-
tion, just as inferrent (above) is subjunctive ot' the reported or alleged
reason. For a somewhat similar instance of carelessness in English,
cp. the sentence, “ He went away because he said it was late.’'

14. imperitatum . . . esse: impersonal passive (literally “that it
had been ruled over the vanquished '’). As imperium-eis an intransitive
verb (and accordingly governs the dative, victis). this is the only way
in which it admits of use in the passive voice. fama est: “there is a
story ‘chata' Upon this phrase depends the rest of the sentence down
to adactum, the subject being Hannibalem, and the main predicate being
iare iem-ando adactum (se. esse), “was bound by oath,'' i.e. “sxvore.’'
Upon this depends se . . . hostem sore. Convertcd into direct narrative
we should have (a) in the first part of the sentence Hannibal . . .
blandiens . . . (almetas . . . adactus esst and (b) in the second part
eye, cnm primum potero, hostis ero.

15. annorum . . . novem: genitive of quality. patri: indirect
object of the intransitive blandientem.

16. Africo bello ε i.e. the Mercenary XVar, sco Introduction, ᾗ iv.

17. eo: “thither‚” i.e. to Spain.

18. sacris: i.e. the ssesh of the victims of the sacrifice.

20. Sicilia sardiniaque amissae: literally “Sicily and Sardinia
lost,'’ i.e. “the loss ot* Sicily and Sardinia.” Similarly urbs capta
= “the capture of the city,’' urbs condita = “the foundation of the
city‚⁷’ interemptus Hector = “the death of Hcetor.'' nam et Siciliam:
the rest of the chapter is in oratio obliqua, depending upon some such
verb as “he thought’' or “he said‚” easily understood from the
context. With concessam and interceptam, sc. esse.

22. motum Africae: the Mercenary NVar. stipendio . . . inposito:
the indemnity of 1,‘200 talents mentioned in the note on l. 13.

Oh. 2-6. ARGUMEN¹1¹.—In Spain Hamilcar was succeeded by Has-
