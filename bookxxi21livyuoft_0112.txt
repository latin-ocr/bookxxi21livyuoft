80 LIVY XXI.

17. ante: to be joined. with quam. For morientes, Cicero or Caesar
would have written mortui sunt ; but the use of antequam with a parti-
ciple is characteristic of Livy's style.

15. 1. de industria : “ on purpose.'’

4. redactum: pecuniam redissem is “to realize a sum of money.”

7. octavo mense, quam: for octavo mense post quam. So again l. 9,
quinto mense quam. For the passive of coeptum with a passive infinitive
(oppugnari), cp. note on 8, 6.

8. quidam : Polybius in particular.

11. fieri non potuit ut, etc. : Livy finds himselfinvolved in a difficulty
as to dates. Briefly, the facts are as follows z-(i) In 6 110 30)*3 that the
siege of Saguntum began in the consulship of Sempronius and Scipio.
(i i) It lasted eight months (15, 7 (iii) Hannibal then went into
winter qua¹1rte1s; and in the next 3ear sta-nted for Italv, which he
reached in five months. cix) Now the 3ear of the consulship of
Sempronius and Scipio was also that of the battle at the Tiebia viz.
218 Β. C (3) Hence it must be supposed th 11 either (1) Saguiitum
was taken in much shorter time and Hannibal at once pushed on to
Ital3·; or (ἱ, ³) the siege 1111131 have commenced 111 219 Β. c.‚ and ended
in 218 B. c.‚ and Hannibal must have pushed on without waiting until
the next spling ; or (3) the siege lasted for eight months in 218 B.c.,
and Hannibal did not reach the Trebia until 217 Rc. The last
supposition is impossible, because Sempronius and Scipio were consuls
in the battle at that place, and the battle must therefore 111το been
foug -'ht 111 111011 3ea1‚ '³18 B. C. (v 1) The true solution is contained in
the C>note on 6, 7, where it 13 shown th 11 Liv3 is mistaken in saying
that Sempionius and Scipio were consuls at the time of the embassy
from Sag 1111111111 and the beginning of the siege. The true date of
the embassy is the latter half of 219 Β. c.‚ and Saguntum was besieged
and 11111 011 01111101) within that 3 ear. So sa3 s Pol3 bius. Liv3 himself
seems to accept 11113 alternatim for in 30, 31, 110 again speaks of
the siege as lasting eight months

12. ad quos· . a iepetition of the mis take already made' 111 6,’” ι.

13. sint . . . pugnaverint: subjunctives by assimilation to fecerint.
suo magistratu: ‘⁶ 111 their own year of office,’' viz. 218 B.c.‚ as eon-
trasted with a possible year or years subsequent, in which they held
office as pro-consuls.

18. excessisse . . . in: “have overflowed into‚⁷’ ie. “have
occurred so late as.” The expression puymz ad Trebiam, ‘⁴ the fight
at the Trebia‚⁷’ would not be admissible in Ciceronian Latin, which
would add some such participle as commissa, “the fight that was
fouqlzt at the Trebia.’'

19. Cn. Servili et C. Flamini: consuls of the year 217 B.c. The
genitive singular of nominatives in -ius was in Livy‘s time generally
written with one i, though Ovid uses -izz

20. Arimini: locative. The argument is as follows: Sempronius
held the consular comitia in Rome aster the fight at Trebia, therefore
Sempronius must have been himself consul at the time (for only a
