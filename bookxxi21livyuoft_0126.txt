30. 3. mirari se: the oratio obliqua continues throughout the
chapter, the sequence being in the main primaryfor the sake of vivid-
ness. ln ll> 20, 35, however, the sequence is historio (finqerent,
cederent). The mixture of sequences is here justified by the rule that
a historic present (versat, l. 3) may take either sequence.

of reported command. In direct speech: Fz'nqz‘le Alpis altiores esse
Pyrenaei inqiS.

should say ‘⁶ mountain life.⁷'

between the city’s walls and the river Tiber, which here makes a wide
westward bend.
