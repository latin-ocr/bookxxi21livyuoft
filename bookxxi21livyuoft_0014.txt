the continent; which they did, sailing southward from the
Red Sea and passing the “Cape of Storms” 2000 years
before Vasco de Gama's time.

The Carthaginians retained all the characteristics of
their ancestors3 but towards 600 Rc. they found them-
selves threatened with the loss of their trade in the
western seaS. The Greeks in Sicily and Magna Graecia
began to usurp much of the commerce of the West; and
in defence of their interests the Carthaginians for the first
time were compelled to fight. They made an alliance with
the Etruscans, the great naval and piratica] Power of
Northern Italy 3 and maintained a long and bloody struggle
with the Greeks headed by Syracuse. They were forced,
however, to retire to the westernmost parts of Sicily, where
they retained the fortresses of Soloeis, Motye‚ and
Panormus. In 474 Bc, Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, defeated
a combined fleet of Carthaginians and Etruscans off the
coast of Campania3 and there is still to be seen in the
British Museum the helmet of one of his vanquished foes,
which he dedicated at Olympia in memory of his victory.
The Etruscan power was now deelining before the growing
strength of Rome, with which state Carthage had already
made a treaty for commercial purposes as early as 509 B.C.,
the very year in which the expulsion of the Tarquins led
to the final breach between Rome and Etruria. This
treaty was renewed, with moffifications, in 348 B.0.‚ and
again in 279 B.c.‚ when Pyrrhus was in Italy.

(f) Government and constitution.

As colonists from Tyre, the Carthaginians imitated in
the main the institutions of the mother-country, particu-
larly in religion. Their gods were Moloch, Baal,
Melcarth (Hercules), and the Phoenician Venus, Astarte.
In government, the cities of Phoenicia seem to have been
a loose confederacy of independent kingdonis or oli-
garchies, holding conventions from time to time at an
appointed centre. Carthage adopted the oligarchic
government; and the original settlers were doubtless the
founders of a Patriciate of the ancient samifies, correr
sponding to the patrician qentes of Rome. Theoretically
