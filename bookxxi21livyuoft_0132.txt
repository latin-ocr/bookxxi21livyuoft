4. ad rupem muniendam: riam munii-eis “ to make a road.'' Hence
rupen} ›nunti-e, “to make a cliff passable‚’' “to construet a road along
a cli .' ’

5. arboribus: the mention of large trees here is hardly in accord
with Livy's descriptione of the ground in 36, 20, and in 1. 13 below.

8. aceto: not vinegar‚ but the “sour wine'’ which the soldiers
carried with them. If limestone is heated, and suddenly drenched
with any cold liquid, it will split ; and thus far the story may have a
little truth in it. Pliny speaks of mines being worked in a similar
way, audit is said that many of the great monoliths of Stonehenge
were thus broken up by the farmers about.

10. anfractibus: ‘⁶ zigzag paths‚” to lessen the steepness of the

deigeiniiimentis . . . absumptis: the ablativo absolute may here be

rendered by a clause beginning “ whereby.”
14. inferiora: substantivaL “the lower slope-s’' of the Alps. So
l. 17, planum, “level qround.’'

Ch. 38-39. ARGUMENT.—Aceouuts differ us to the number of
Hannibal'sforees on his arrirul in Italy: the hiqhest fiyure is 120,000‚
the lou-est 263000. Hannibal himself admitted the loss of ’36,000 men
during] thefire months’ march from Curthaqo ZVoru to Italy. There is a
further question as to the route by which he crossed the Alps, which is the
more remarkable, because ull authorities ayree that the Puss by which he
came brouyht him direct to the Taurini. Thai he erossed by the Pennino
Puss is absurd. The Taurini und the Insubres being] at war, Hannibal
attach-ed und tooh· the town of the former, and so passed on down the Padus
Vulley, the Gauls as a whole tenzporisinq. Thus at lust the two yreutest
qeneruls of the aye met for the first time on the Rirer Ticinus.

38. 1. maxime : “pretty much.”

2. quinto mense a: so we might say “in the fifth month out from
Carthage.⁷' As it is measure, not motion, that is concerned, the pre-
position is required. quidam : especially Polybius. Auctor esse is “ to
be responsible for '' an assertion, and so “ to assert.” This paren-
thesis (ut . . . sunt) applies only to what precedes.

6. qui minimum ε Polybius mentions 12‚000 African infantry, 8 ‚000
Spanish infant1y‚ and 6,ΟΟΟ cavalry.

8. moveret: “would sway,” “would influence.'’

9. cum his : ‘⁶ in addition to these.”

10. adducta : i.e. (Cincius scribit) adducta esse in Italiam.

13. transierit: the mood is that of a dependent clause in oratio
obliqua, but strict sequence would require a historic tense (transisset).

14. amississe ε euni (Hannibalem) is to be understood as subject.

15. degresso : sc. Hannibali, dative with proxuma.

16. ambigi: impersonal, ‘⁴ that the question should be raised.”
