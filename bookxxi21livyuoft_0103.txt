03011 (to do so),'' the. “ each b3v the shortest wa3'.’'

01 adjectives, especially those of three terminations, in prepositional
phrases; cp. de inteqro, 6, 15.

46. reciperent: when antequam and priusquam are found with the
indicative, the only assertionis that one thing occurred before another;
but when these conjunc-tiens are used with the subjunctive, it is implied

those 01 218 Β.0., whereas the embassy of the Saguntines occurred in
the year preceding (219 B.c.). See further on 15, 11.
