1.-LIFE AND METHOD OF LIVY.

'l'itus Livius was born at Patavium (Padua), whence
he took his cognomen of Patavinus, between the years 59
and 57 ΒΑ). The exact date is uncertain. He was prob-
ably of good family, to judge from the aristocratic tone of
his writings, and from the fact that the O. Cornelius who
took the auspiees before the battle of Pharsalia (48 nc.)
was a relative of his. At Patavium, the populous and busy
town of the Veneti in the eastern district of Trans-Padane
Gaul, near the mouth of the Po, he probably learned to
declaim in public, as was usual; but he early moved to
Rome, where he spent much of his life, dying at his native
place in 17 AJJ. at the age of about 75. His first books
(L-X.) are supposed to have been published before 20 B.c.,
and from that date to his death he was unceasingly busy
with his work. Hc was a friend of the Emperor Augustus,
although himself one who regretted the Republic and
applauded Caesar-’s murderers. He seems to have had
nothing to do with politics, and was so enabled to devote
all his time to the task before him. Augustus' accession
closed the history of Republican Rome. Livy volunteered
to systematise that history—the history of. 700 years.
Livy is the first Latin historian, with the exception of
Caesar, whose works have come down to us to any large
extent. There are 30 books still extant, together with
portions of 5 others, and an epitome of the whole up to the
142nd book. To write the History of Rome from her
