82 Livy xxr.

3. in eum annum: we say “for that ycar.'⁷ ἱ

4. socium: 1110 older form of the genitive plural (= sociorum).
This form rarely occurs in Classical Latin prose except in the case of
(a) names of peoplos‚ tribes3 (b) names of trades, measures‚ coins
(fabrum, modium, nummum, sestertium) ; and (e) cardinal and distributive
numerals. ipsis: the consuls; 1110 point was usually decided by the
Senate. videretur: “might seem qood.’' This use of videor as a
verb of complete predication is 00010100.

6. scripta: “enrolled‚’⁷ because “written down'’ on the lists
mille octingenti: i.e. 100 turmae of thirty men for each legion, as
was usual.

8. quinqueremes: “having five banks of oars ” 011 each side. All
ships of war (nares lowtyae) were propclled by oars, the rowers being·
arranged in tiers one above the other. Five rows was the normal
munber at this date, but smaller vessels of four, or three banks (quadri-
remes, triremes, 22, 15) were also used. [This is the usual explana-
tion. Experiment, however, claims 10 have shown that such an
arrangement is impracticable; but as no alternative explanation is
effered‚ the traditione] one must stand for the present] celoces:
“dispatch boats⁷' of lighter bmthen and driven by single banks of
oars. Except in Livy the word is feminine.

9. latum: adpopulmn ferre is “to refer (a matter) to the people '’
in comitia. vellent iuberent : the actual wording of the proposal was
felitis iubentis (potential subjunctive) . . . bellum iudici ‚² ‘⁴ would it
be your will and command that war be declared? ’⁷

12. quod bellum: “the war which.’' laesisset is subjunctive of
reported definition‚ the prayer being bene eveniat qnod . . . iussit.

14. ea: not eae, though referring to lessiones, but assimilated in
gender to the nearest predicate, milia. quaterna . . . treceni: the
distributive numerals imply that this was the total of each legion.

16. naves longae: “ships of war,” in eontrast with the shorter
and broader transport vessels (narres onerariae).

18. ita . . . si: “only . . . if,⁷’ as in 13, 16. So again 19, 7.

23. ea parte belli: ‘⁶ in that branch of warfare‚” zze. by sea.

25. iusto equitatu: “the proper complement of cavalry,'’ which
was 300 to the legion.

28. eodem versa: “intended for the same object‚'⁷ explained by in
Punicum bellum. Versa is neuter plural, referring to all the preceding
accusatives. The ‘⁴ province of Gaul ’⁷ here meant is Gallia Cisalpina,
Rome having nothing to do with Transalpine Gaul for nearly a
century after this date.

⁴⁹38. -2. maiores natu: “ senior.” Natu is an ablative (of respect),
ᾖ ξὲξῧὲοηθῑ 1110 -ne serves to introduce the single (indirect)
