In succession Hannibal over-came the Olcades, the
Carpetani, and the Vaccaei, ravaging central Spain from
the mountains of Castile to the Douro. A formidable
coalition of the tribes in his rear, while himself was in the
far N.W.‚ was defeated in a bloody battle upon the Tagus.
He then turned his attention to Saguntum.

Saguntum was an ancient Greek colony upon the
Ε. coast, due W. of the Balearic Isles, now Murviedro. It
had bccn founded by fugitives from Zacynthus, for which
word Saguntum is the old-Latin equivalent3 and it was
said that some Rutulians from Ardea, the people of
Virgil's Turnus, had joined the colony: a story probably
invented to give Rome a pretence for blood-relationship
with the Spanish town. By the treaty of 228 B.c.
Saguntum was recognised as an ally of Rome, and was
not to be molestcd. Hannibal was too wisc to leave a

threats were enough now, as they had been when Sardinia
was surrendered, sent envoys to warn Hannibal to desist.
Phe latter was already sar on with the siege. Hc dcclined
to sec the envoy& and they crcssed over to Carthage.
Here too they wore repulsed3 and returned without
success to Rome. But a few days later came the news of
the fall ancl sack of Saguntum (end of 219 13.c.)‚ after a
siege of eight months. A second envoy was at once sent
to Carthage. “ Was Saguntum attacked bv the State’s
commands, or by Hannibal's orders alone?'' was the
question put by the envoy. The Oarthaginians were
exasperated by Rome’s insolence, and roused to stand by
their successful general. They refused to answer the
question. “Then‚’' said Fabius, “in this fold of my robe
1 carry for you peace and war. Take which you wffl.''
“Give us which you wi11,’' was the answer. And the
