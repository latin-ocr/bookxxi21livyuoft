INTROD UCTION. vii

IL—CARTHAGE.

(a) Its Position.

The city of Carthage, now desolate, stood upon the
western shore of the Bay of Tunis, a few miles southward
from the estuary of tho Bagradas (Mejerda). It was thus
due west of the southernmost point of Sicily (Pachynum) ;
while Selinus on tho SW. coast of that island was distant
only ninety miles from tho Heraean promontory (O. Bon),
which forms the eastern side of the Bay of Tunis.

The Bay of Tunis is one of the few safe harbours on tho
north coast of Africa. Tho coast-line from the Straits
of Gibraltar to the Bagradas runs eastward with very few
indentations. Beyond tho Heraean headland it turns
abruptly southward toward the modern kingdom of
Tripoli, thus forming the great curvo known to the ancients
as the Syrtes (or ‘⁶ D1·ifts’'). From thence to Suez the
coast is only broken hy tho headland of Cyrene and the
delta of the Nile.

The peninsula of Italy, Sicily, and the Cape of Bon, form
as it were the waist of the Mediterranean Sea, which opens

⁷ out to the east into the Ionian ancl Aegean Seas, and to the

west into the Mare Tyrrhenum or Inferum. Carthage was
thus situated in the bost possible position for commanding
alike the eastern and western wators, and the trade of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, at one and the same time3 and
herein lay the cause of her early prosperity and her lnighty
resources.

(b) 'l'he soil, elimate, διο.

The whole area of North Africa, from Cyrene, a Greek
colony on the N.W. of Egypt, to the base of O. Bon, is a
sandy desert, admitting only of a very narrow margin
of cultivated coast-line. Tunis, however, and the districts
to the west of Tunis, Algeria, and Morooco (Numidia and
Mauretania) are of a different stamp. Pliny records that
the soil of Carthago yielded often 150-f01d3 and to this
