76 LIVY xxi.

11. si . . . vivat: the construction represents, in Hannibal's own
words, (mm mihi est via) si vivam (future). ex bellis bella: “war
after war‚'’ a common meaning of ex. For the metaphor of serendo,
cp. litis sator, 6, 3.

12. materiam: not “material‚” but literally “wood'' (the usual
meaning) as fuel.

16. per quos: “through whose aid.’' With ulti sunt, se. Romani,
understood from Romanae leqzssones. rupta foedera: Livy makes
Hanno say that the Carthaginians deserved to be beaten in the First
Punic XVar, because it was they who had committed the first breach of
the peace. Livy is thinking of the traditional story, that the war was
brought about by the appearance of a Punic fleet off Tarentum in
272 B.C. to support that town, in spite of a treaty which forbade them
to enter Tarentino waters. But (1) Polybius says there was no such
treaty3 (2) it* they were, a breach of it in 272 B.c. could not account
for a war which only broke out in 264 B.C. ; and (3) we know that the
real cause of? the war was the interference of Rome on behalf of the
Mamertines of Messina (see Introduction, p. xii.).

19. bonus: ironical.

20. ius gentium: it was part of the ias omnium, ‘⁴ rights of man‚'’
that envoys should be admitted to audience.

21. ex foedere : ‘⁴ in aeeordmwe with the torms of the treaty.’' Res
repetere is “to demand satisfaction.”

22. publica fraus: fraus is “ wrong-doing‚” publiea frans, wrong-
doing to which the entire nation is a party. It' the government of
Carthage refused to give the required satisfac-tion, they made the State
at large a party to what the Romans alleged to be a wrong.

23. reum criminis: “him that is arraigned on the charge.”
Crimen properly means a ‘⁶ charge‚'’ ⁴* accusation‚” rarer a “ crime.’'
quo . . . eo: cp. 8, 24. Et must be understood between the
clauses ayunt . . . incipiunt, which are coordinate.

24. coeperint: perfect subjunctive by assimilation to saeviant,
representing the future-perfect (coeperint). Coepi serves as perfect of
mezwpzo.

25. Aegatis: for the spelling, cp. hostis, 5, 43, and note, quae:
“ and all the reverses which.”

28. isti : senators who belonged to the Barcine party. Volunt here
means “make out‚⁷' “represent.”

30. uter . . . rupisset: dependent question, explaining id, “the
question that was in dispute, namely‚ which of the two §tates had
broken the peace.'’

31. unde : i.e. cuius er parte, ‘⁴ on whose side.’'

32. ei victoriam dedit: instead ot* writing diiudicarit, “this the
issue detennined,'’ Livy substitutos unde ius stabat, ei victoriam dedic,
making the construction irregular, though the sense is clear enough.
Carthagini: emphatic by position. So is the next sentence. turres:
i.e. turres mobiles (11, 24), lofty towers of timber, carrying catapults
and other engines of war. Running on wheels, like vineae, they could
be pushed forward and used to dn've the defenders from their walls.
