viii INTRODUCTION.

day, amid wretched cultivation, phenomenal harvests are
not uncommon. There are numerous rivers in this western
region, though Tripoli and the eastern shores are almost
destitute of water. The general barrenness of Africa
and the eontrasted fertility of Cyrene and Carthage were
proverbial amongst the ancients. And while in Tripoli
and Cyrenaica rain is a precious rarity‚ at Carthago and
to the westward there is at least a sufficieney. There still
romain, however, on the site of the city, a series of enor-
mous roek-hewn oisterns whieh prove at once the need of
eeonomising water, and the sagacity and engineering skill
of the ancient Carthaginians.

(Vc) The Town.

The oldest portion of the town was, as usually happens,
the citadel, Bosra (from the Canaanitish, z a fort), or, as

To the north and west ot the Byrsa lay the city proper,

war with Rome, was 700,000; and when at the close of
that war it was sacked and fired by the Romans, its ruins

(cl) 1ts Origin.

Herodotus says that the Phoenicians emigrated from the
head of the Persian Gulf and founded Tyre about* the year
2800 B.c.; and there is no reason to doubt his story. From
Tyre they spread at first north and south along the coast
of the Levant, and gave the name of Phoenicia to that
region-a region which never exeeeded 150 miles in length
and 30 in its widest breadth, but averaged rather less than
5 miles in width. They never attempted to gain an inland
power. Trade was their one object, and so long as they
were left at liberty to trade they cared little whether they
were subject to Assyria or Egypt, or any other great
Eastern Power. From Phoenicia they sailed to all parts of
the Mediterranean. They planted their faetories (or trad-
