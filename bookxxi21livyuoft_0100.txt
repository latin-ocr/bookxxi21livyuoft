15. libidini: libido is the conduct of a man who does as he likes (ut
libet), ‘⁴ caprice.’' an hoc timemus: “ surely we have no sear of
this.’' An properly introduces the second and subsequent members
of a eompound question, direct or indii-oct (eff. 4, 11). XVhen used, as
here, to introduce a single direct question, it implies that the question
is only rhetorically asked and is practieally equivalent to a negation.

16. regni paterni: “such a sovereignty as his father enjoyed.’'
Cp. reglis in the next line. Hamilcar was not rex, and never enjoyed
reynerum buthe had done very much as he liked in Spain, and his
opponent Hanno uses the words sarcastically.

17. euius regis: in English the substantive must be transferred to
the antecedent clause (ebus . . . serviamus). hereditarii: ‘⁴ as an
inheritance‚” with a sneer at the way in which the Barcini had mono-
polised control of the armies in Spain. sint relicti: subjunctive by
assinulation, being dependent upon another verb in that mood

ser-mamus .
< 20. aeqixo: here in the sense of “ equal‚” “impartial.’' ne quan-
doque : ne qnando is more usual.

4. 1. optimus quisque: “all the best (w. most patriotio).'’

2. vicit: “ prevailed over ’' ; also absolutely in 6, 21.

finite verb (eredebant) ς so intueri. This idiom is confined to (a) prin-
cipa] sentences, (b) the present tense of the infinitive, and (c) the first
and third persons. It is also (d) usually employed only in graphio and
hurried narrative. so here it suggests the “flutter'' among the
troops on Hannibal’s arrival.

6. habitum . . . lineamentaque: the two words differ as “ex-
pression '⁵ from ‘⁶ features.''

7. brevi: sc. tempore, “quicffl>⁷.” pater in se: “ (what there
was of) his father in him,” vste. “his likeness to his father.’'
momentum: “force” or ‘⁶ motive.” The word (from movire,
suffimentum) means originally what “moves ’' or “turns '' the beam
of a. pair of scales.

9. parendum atque imperandum: the gerunds are in apposition to
res diversissimas.

10. discerneres: potential subjunctive, m. subjunctive in the
apodosis of a conditional sentence of which the protasis is suppressed,
“you could not easily have deterinined (if yon had tried).'⁷ Thus
used potentially the imperfect subjunctive refers to past time. The
second person singular subjunctive is often used where the subject is
(as here) indefinite (= French on).

12. malle . . . confidere . . . audere: historic infinitives, for maluit,
confim sunt, ansi sunm see note on eredere, 1. 5.
