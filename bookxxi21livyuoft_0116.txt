of extent.

5. priore foedere: the treaty as drafted by Lutatius, before it· was
amended by the Senatc.

6. conparandum erat: the verb sum accompanied by a gerund or
verbal adjective, and the verbs possum, debeo, decet, oportet, are in the
apodoscs of conditional sentences commonly uscd in a past tense of
the indicative, where other verbs would be in the imperfect or pluper-
fect subjunctive. Commo-andum erat = “could be comparcd'’; the
gerundivo when a negative is exprossed or (as here) implied often
corresponds to an English adjective ending in -ble‚ eff. ‘⁵' coniparable.'’
diserte: “clearlyss' 011111 . . . additum esset . . . fuerit . . .
conprobatum sit: these are causal clauses giving thc reasons whereby
the speaker justifies his implied statement that the cases of the two
treatics are not parallel. The change of tense may bc partly for the
sake of variety, partly with a view to greater vividness in the mention
of the treaty actually under discussion.

7. ita . . . si: “only on condition that'’; cp. 17, 18. ratum:
“ ratified,” “confirmed,⁷' another and very common instance of the
participle of a deponent verb (reor) having a passive force; cp. inritus

the Carthaginian govcrnment is overlooked. quamquam : resumptive,
“and yet‚'⁷ a common usage.

11. etsi priore foedere staretur: “ even if the disputants stood upon
the former treaty,⁷’ aste. based their arguments upon it. The author-
ised treaty of 241 Rc, is meant, as prior to that made by Hasdrubal.
cautum erat: cp. 18, 24.

13. ne: sc. cautum esset iis, “that there was to be no proviso as
regards those ” who should subsequently be admitted to alliance.

16. tantum ne: here too a predicate must be supplied, eg. id
