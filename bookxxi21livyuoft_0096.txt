than uma,- haud is very commonly used (as here) with adfflveff‘a’hd
advefb‘fbeginning with a negative prefix (1η- or (lima).

clause (⁴‘because . . . ’'). The participle *indiynantibzcs must be
repeated with Poenis in the same construction.

12. victoribus: dative of the indirect object with arma inferrent
(= ‘⁴ attacked ''). The Romans arc meant, as vieti denotes the
Carthaginians, with reference to the issue of the First Punic ΨΜ.

with a view to enforcing the Roman demands. The refusal of Rome
to make peace in 241 B.C. save on harder terms than those granted by
Lutatius Catulus (Introduction, p. xiii.) may also have been in the
writer’s mind. crederent: we should expect the indicative credebant.
The subjunctive may be explained in two ways. (1) It is due to
assimilation to the mood of efferrent in the corresponding clause above.
