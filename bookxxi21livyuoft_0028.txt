their descriptions of the actual ascent and passage 01 1119
Alps. But it has generally been held that their accounts
of the intermediate portion of the march are inconsistent.
Livy expressly says :that Hannibal marched by one or
other of the passes to which the Druentia va-lley leads.
If Polybius' account is different, he must refer to some
other 11999, 9111191 10 1119 Mont Cenis or to the Little St. Ber-
nard. The former is reached by following the valley of
the 19919 and its tributary the Arc; the latter by the Isere
valley. Most authorities held that Polybius had the Little
St. Bernard in his mind.

(1.) Τ1119 11911 leads to a further difficulty. Livy says
that everyone was agreed that the first ltalian people
whom Hannibal encountcred 11919 1119 Taurini3 and there
is nothing in Polybius to contradict this. Now the
Taurini (111911 around what is now Turin (220². “the Colony
of Augusta of the Taurini ’') and in the valley of the Dora
Riparia. The only passes leading into that valley are the
Mont Gencvre and the Mont Cenis. The Little St. Bernard
is too far to 1119 1101111; 1119 Col d'Argentiere too far to
the south. It follows 111911 that if Polybius and Livy
thought of de‘ffiwnt passos, they 1111191 have thought of the
Cenis and 1119 (19119119, respectively. If they thought of
the same pass, that pass was most probably the Genevre.

(vi.) It has now been conclusively shown¹ that there·is
nothing inconsistent in the two accounts of Polybius
and. Livy. The former wrote without niuch reference to
names of places and rivers, at that date unknown to the
bulk 01 1119 readers3 and as a result it became difficult to
identify the route which 119 described. Hence, even in
Livy's day (Ch. xxxviii„ ξ 6) 1119 actual route of Hannibal
was already matter 01 doubt 10 111091 pcople. Livy set
himself 10 0011901 11119 by carefully specifying such places,
rivers, tribes, ete„ as were important. But in thus doing
he 19 merely elaborating, not contmdicting, Polybius.

Alps, but rather 10 1119 left⁷' (Livy), that is, as Polybius
says, “along the river,⁷' 12'.e. the Isara (whose lower course
