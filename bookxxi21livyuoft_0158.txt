early times they were the dreaded enemies of Rome, having defeated

the Capitol in 390 B.C. In 225 B.c. a fresh incursion was made at
the invitation of the Boii (qr), but it was crushed at the battle of
Telamon (see also Introduction, ᾧ v.) Large bodies of Gauls joined
Hannibal, while others, as the Volcae on the Rhene and the mountain-

Gallia, -ae, f. : the country of the Gauls. The name of Gauls was
applied to all Celtic tribes on either side of the Alps. Hence the

is now known as France was called Gallia Transalpina. Cisalpine
Gaul was again divided by the river Po (Padus) into Transpadane
Gaul to the north, and Cispadane to the south. In the former dwelt
the Cenomani, Insubres, and Taurini; in the latter, the Boii,
extending into Northern Etrmia. On the east, Cisalpine Gaul was
bordered by the Veneti and other Illyrian tribes about the head of the
Adriatic ; on the west by the Ligures and the Alps.
