INTRODUCTION. xi

the popular assembly had a right to discuss more im-
portant questions of government3 but over this a senate
of 300, and over them again a smaller council of 100,
had complete control. The latter body is stated to have
been created expressly to prevent any one citizen from
becoming too powerful, a contingency which was proved
by the examples of Hamilcar and Hannibal to be not
unlikely. Besides these various assembh'es there were a
board of five State officials, a Commander-in-Chief, and
two J udges (Suffetes; from the chr. Skophet, a judge),
who had religious as well as judicial functions and presided
at meetings of the Senate. They were appointed conjointly
by the Senate and the people.

At the time of the first and second Punic XVars, the
government was in the hands of two great patrician
families, that of Hamilcar, the Harii-ines or war-party,
and that of Hanno, the [mace-party ‹Jr Romanizers. The
latter were at violent fcud with the· former, particularly
after the mercenary war in which Hamilcar had been
preferred to Hanno as [¹1›minander-in—Chief.

HL—CARTHAGE ANI) ROME.

The first battleficld of Carthaginians and Romans was
· Sicily. For two ventui-ies (e. 5‹)0—30‹›1;.c.> the former
had been fruitlessly cmleav‹j›uring to ‹lrive the Greek
colonists out of the island. In the year of the battle of
Salamis, when Xerxes and the power of Persia were dis-
tracting the attention of the Grecian Statcs at home, the
Carthaginians had chosen their opportunity to make a
gigantic attempt upon Sicily. But at that date Syracuse
was the strongest of any existing Grecian State, and at
the battle of Himera (p. x) Gelo, tyrant of Syracuse, was
general of the Sicilian Greeks. Again in 339 Ro. Timoleon
the Corinthian cleared the island by his great victory
on the Crimessus ; and when, after his death, the Cartha-
ginians once more attacked Syracuse, Agathocles turned
the tables upon them by invading Africa, where he
ravaged the whole province of Carthage for four years,
supported by the revolted African tribes (310—307 13.c.).
