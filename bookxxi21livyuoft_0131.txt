Nou-s. - 99

26. uno aut summum altero z “ one, or at most two.'' Summum is
accusative of extent.

29. nihil ne . . . quidem: the two negatives do not here cancel
each other, as usually happens in Latin. per occasionem: cp. 8, 17.
- 31. ab Italia: “ on the Italian side.⁷' Multo modifics difficilius, and
ceterum is here the adjective.

34. possent: sc. the troops. qui . . . titubassent: generic sub-
junctive, a variety ot the consecutive use (qui = “ such as ‘').

35. †adfficti: “when they had fallen.'' They could not stop
where they fell, but went sliding down the slope. There is a con-
jectura] reading adfixi, “ fixed.” i.c. “ firm‚'' which is casier.

36. 2. rectis saxis: ablative of description with rupem.. Rupis
may here be rendered “ pass.'’ temptabundus z ‘⁶ feeling his way.'⁷
Another of these participiul udjcctivcs (most of which Livy is the first
or only writer to use), contionabundus, occurs in 53, 18. Elsewhere
Livy uses cunctabundus, mirabundus, and other such forms.

4. natura: with praeceps, “naturally steep.’' With the ablative,
cp. silentio, 33, 30.

5. in . . . altitudinem: according to Polybius the road had become
so narrow as to be impassable for a length of a furlong and a half,
doubtlcss through the action of a glacier. Livy, however, seems to
have misunderstood this, and to imply by in altitudinem that there was a
sheer drop of 1000 feet. The words in pedam mille are a conjectural
emendation of the MSS. readings impeditus illc and i212pedilzcs dum ille.

8. digressus: the omission of est here and after cisa in the next
line is somewhat harsh. ”

10. circumduceret: the rendering “it scemed certain that he must
lead his troops round ’² represents the general meaning well enough,
but it is doubtful if the subjunctive can thus imply necessity, and it is
safer to take dubia res as ‘⁶ a matter admitting hesitation '' and to con-
strue “the matter seemed such as not to admit of hesitation on his
part to lead his army round.'’ quamvis: to be taken with lonqo,
‘⁶ however long.’'

13. molli nec praealtae z sc. niz-i, dative with insistebant.

15. dilapsa est : ‘⁶ it had melted.'' The ablativo incessu is causal.

17. in prono : “ on the slope ’' of the mountain side.

18. citius: πλε. all the more quickly than if the surface had been
level instead of sloping.

19. adiuvissent: the subjunctive is (1) iterative, and (2) required
by the subordination of the clause to the consecutive clause ut . . .
corruerent.

20. ad quas ; “ by the help of which,'’ literally “ against which.''

21. levi: from licis. tantum: “only‚'' ‘⁶ nothing but.’'

the object of secabant.
