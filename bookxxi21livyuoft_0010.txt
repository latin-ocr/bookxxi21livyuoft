vi INTRODUGTION.

foundation to the time of Augustus was no light task, and
Livy had intended to complete it in 15 parts of 10 books
each, or a total of 150 books. It is probable that the last
8 books were never written.

There were no models of style for him to imitate. As
yet, history was a crude subject with the Romans. Thus
far it had been recorded mainly as “Fasti‚'’ that is, year-by-
year records of the electioris, names of the consuls, religious
matters, and the principa] events of national impet-tance.
Traces of this survive in Livy’s arrangement of his history
by yearS, a habit which continues even down to Tacitus’
time at the end of the first century A.D. It must bc
remembered that dates wore fixed by the names of thc
consuls, and that there was no other recognised method ot
keeping count of time,

This division of history into years prevents any con-
tinuous history in which the cause and sequence of events
is properly indicated. As yet, there was no such thing as
a Philosophioal History of Rome.

Livy was no critic. He compiled his work freely from
various sources, including almost all previous annalists.
He omitted what he chose to regard as needless3 and, in
accordance with the Roman custom,l1e rarely mentions his
authority for a bom-owed passage. Vcry rarely too does
he raise alternative views or debate dubious points, as in
the account of the Embassy to Saguntum and of the out-
break of the Boian WVar of 219 B.c. (see caps. xv„
§33 xxv„ 4.)

He did nit care to vcrify by personal observation diffi-
culties of geography. Nor was he an antiquarian‚ though
the monuments of a nation are amongst the surest and
most essential data of its history.

His aim was· to give, without excess of detail and with
no systematic criticism, the annales of Rome from first to
last as a readable whole. In this he certainly succeeded,
and his work remained, to Rome’s latest days, one of the
books of the nation. But he was a poet and a raconteur
rather than a writer of history, and he cares more for
polished style and taking passages than for accuracy of
detail and scientific continuity.
