predicate. Is, ea, id, followed by ut and a subjunctive, is the equiva-
lent of the English “ such (that).'’ dolores z objectos superante, which
stands with laetitia in the ablative absolute.

22. praebuerit: the usual sequence would be praeberet 3 see the note
.0nsueritzt‚ l, 10.

23. mirae artis . . . fuerat: genitive of quality doing duty as
predicate (predicative genitive); cp. the similar use of the ablativo
above, eo fuit habitu oris.

24. foedus: the trcaty of 241 B.C. ut: “to the effect that‚’' these
consecutive clauses giving the purport of the additions made in the
revised treat ⁷.

26. 1118ᾱίἰὲ : this is inaccurate, inasmuch as Saguntum lay consider-
ably to the south of the Ebro.

3. 1. in Hasdrubalis locum: as there is no construction for these
words in the present text, it is probable that the sentence is an instance
of anacoluthon, te. begins in one way and ends in another, so as to
be graminatically irregular. Translate ‘⁶ to fill Hasdrubal's place.⁷'

2. praerogativam militarem: we should say “his nomination by
the army.⁷' The word praev-offatim is borrowed from the methods of
Roman comitia ιβ( polling'')‚ in which the voting was by centuries or
tribes. The praeroqativa (sc. centuria or tribus) was the one selected
by lot to record its vote first. The word praere-qaam was also used
(as here) in the derived sense of “first vote.'' It refers to the
action of the troops in Spain, who chose Hannibal as their new com-
mander without waiting for instructions from the Government at
home.

3. praetorium: “headquarters.⁷' So again, 43, 41. This too
is a Roman expression, and strictly means the general's tent, which

“he that goes before‘’ the host). The word occurs in the sense of
“ commander ” in l. 15 below.

6. acta: rem affere is “to debate a matter.⁷’ The senatus here
referred to is of course that of Carthago, just as plebs is used above for
the Commons of Carthage. Barcinis: substantival‚ “those of the
Barcine party‚'' for which see note on 2, 12.

8. aecum: the early Latin form was aequom; the weakening of o to u
resulted first in aemon, and later in aequum. So with other words
containing a Ic- sound followed by a ec-sound; e.g. eqwls, ecus, equus ‚·
ᾳαὲηι, εξωίη, quum. blslffus here bears the not uncommon meaning of
‘⁴ air,’ ‘reasona e.

10. ancipitis: “ambio guous. ‘⁹

12 fruendum praebuit: “gave to the service of” (lit. to be en joy ed
by), the predicative gerundive expressing purpose. The gerundive
even of deponent verbs' 1s always passive in meaning.

13. eum: resuming the word flor-,em Repetere is “ ‘to claim in
returnss'

14. pro: “ by way 0f‚” “ under pretence of.'’
