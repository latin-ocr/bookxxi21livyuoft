the traitor Demetrius as her superior and governor of
Illyria, 228 13.c. The Histri, a petty tribe of Northern
Illyria, sided in this war with the rest of the nation.

In 225 B.c. began the Gallie War. As early as 295
ΒΛ). the Senonian Gauls had been annihilated at Sentinum ;
and twelve years later tl1e Boians had been crushed at
the battle of Vadimo (283 13.C.). Since then they had
remained quiet, occupying the parts of upper Italy south
of the Padus (Po), from Picenum and Umbria on the
Adriatic, to the Gulf of Genea. Two colonies had been
sent out to the eastern district, Sena Gallica and
Ariminum. This roused the jealousy of the Gauls ; and
when in 232 C. Flaminius, afterwards the commander at
Trasimenus, proposed to distribute more of the Ager
Gallicus amongst the poorer Roman citizens, the Gauls
became rebellious. For four years the law was not put
into effect: and it was not until 225 nc. that the Boians,
supported by the 1nsubres from Gallia Transpadana, and
other Gauls from Gallia Narbonensis, made a raid into
Etruria. At Faesulae, near Florence, they defeated a.
Roman P1·aet0r; but shortly afterwards found themselves
entrapped at Telamon, between the Consul Atilius, who
had crossed from Sardinia to N. Etruria, and his colleague
Aemilius Papus, who was following in their rear. A
battle followed iu which the Boians were almost anni-
hilated ; and in the next year all the Gauls south of the Po
submitled, 224 B.c. Flaminius, consul in 223 B.c., invaded
tl1e Insubrian lands ou the N. of the Po aud won a battle,
and in 222 B.G. Marcellus defeated and slew Viridomarus,
tl1e chief of the Insubres, captured their capital, Medio-
lanum (Milau), and reduced the whole region to peace.
In 220 B.c. were founded the Coloniae of Placentia on the
S. and Cremona on the N. bank of the Po, and the
Flaminian Way was constructed across the Ager Gallicus
from Ariminum to Rome.

In 219 Bc. Demetrius again turned traitor. In one
campaign ( Second Illyrian War) he was forced to take
refuge in Macedonia, a tribute was imposed upon Illyria,
and Corcyra, Apollonia, and Dyrrachium were occupied
by Roman garrisons. In this year was sent the embassy
