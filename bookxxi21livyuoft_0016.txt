A desultory series of hostilitics followed until 264 B.0.,
when another Hiero was tyrant of Syracuse.

Some Campanian mercenaries—Mamertines‚ or ‘⁴ Chil-
dren of Mars,’' as they called themselves—had seized the
town of Messina„ upon the Straits of Messina. Hiero
made war upon them3 and, unable to resist, the
Mamortines were dividcd in mind. One party was in
favour of calling in the aid of Rome; the other, that of
Cartliage. The latter prevailed for a little while3 but
the Romanizing party soon recovered the ascendancy‚ and
in their turn sent off an embassy to beg for help. By the
time that it reached the Senam, Carthage had already
come into the field. So good an opportunity of getting
the entre'e of Sicily was not to be lost. The Romans
warned the Carthaginians to keep their hands off, while
the latter prepared to defend their rights. Thus the two
nations went 10 war 10 decide which was to have 1116
privilege of chastising Syracuse. ”

The Pirst Punic War began in 264 Rc„ and ended in
241 Β.0., after astruggle of twenty-four years. The whole
scene of action was 13116 island of Sicily and the neigh-
bouring seas, with the exception of Regulus' brief
campaign in Africa. At the outset of hostilities the
Romans found their supplies threatened, their commerce
destroyed, their coast-lines insusted, and their sieges·
rendered useless, loy the fleets of Carthage which com-
manded the sca. Hitherto Rome had had no fieet. She
now determined 10 build one3 and by good fortune won
the battle of Mylae (260 Bc). But seamen cannot be
trained in a day. Fleet after fleet was wrecked or
defeated3 and, disheartened loy disasters, the Roman
efforts were again confined to a land-warfare. In 255 B.o.
Regulus attempted to transfer the war, as Agathocles had
done, 10 Africa. His success at first was immense; but,
growing over-confident, he was completely defeated by
Xanthippus, and himself taken prisoner. Every one
knows the story of his being sent to Rome to sue for
peace, of his refusing 10 enter the city, and his advising
the Senate to reject the Carthaginian overtures, although
he knew his conduct would eost him his life.
