'Phen follow ed a weary succession of siege8‚ at Lilybaeum
(250) and Drepanum (248), in which the Romans
gradually prevailed, but only at immense cost of blood
and time. But even here they were foiled at last by the
sudden appearance of Hamilcar Barca as General of the
Carthaginians (247 B.c.). He seized the fortresses of
Erote and Eryx, where, with his fleet to keep open his
communicamus, he could defy the Roman blockades and
siege trains. For five years he did so: and theu in
despair the Romans made one last effort for the sea.
They built a new fleet, and with it G. Lutatius, the
consul of 241 B.c., wou the battle of the Aeycttes Insulae,
and so cut off Hamilcar's supplies. Resistance was use-
less now, aud Hamilcar submitted. A treaty was agreed
upon by himself and Lutatius, by which Carthage was to
evacuate Sicily, give up all Roman prisoners of war, and
pay iu twenty years ‘2200 talents¹ as an indemnity. By
the constitution of Rome, the power of making war and
peace rested only with the Senate and the people con-
jointly. Hence the treaty of Lutatius was not accepted;
and a new treaty was arranged by which the indemnity
was raised to 3,2OO talents² to be paid in ten years, the
other stipulatione remaining the same. The Carthaginiaus
and Romans were to be auios, defensive and offensive‚
and neither should make war upon the allies of the
other.

'she Romans had been in the wrong in attacking
Cartbage3 and they tried to gloss over their misdoing by
alleging as the cause of the war the fact that a Cartha-
ginian squadron had appeared off Tarentum in ‘272 B.c. in
defiance of the treaty of 279 13.c. Polybius, however, says
that that treaty contained no clause to prevent the
Carthaginians from appear-ing in Italian waters3 and in
any case, it was unlikely that a war would have been
commenced to revenge an iusult committed eight years
before, and hitherto unmentioned. This is the view taken
by Hanno in his speech (cap. x., §8) advocating the
snrrender of HannibaL
